Hello, I'm M.spicata, and welcome to 99 000 000.xyz (pronounced 99 million dot xyz). The first question you are probably thinking of is "why on earth did you purchase this domain name?" Here are my reasons:

- It was rather cheap (1 USD/year)
- I thought it would be funny
- I could do it
- I wanted to do it
- 99 000 000 has no real meaning, so I could assign it one, and I wouldn't be limited by that later on
- It is fairly memorisable

Also, I can use the subdomains now. Here are the stuff on 99 000 000.xyz (for now):
